# Ansible Playbooks for SquidsAWS
These are the playbooks I have made for deploy various instances in my AWS Environment. These playbooks do various things from deploy and configure developer ec2 instances, jenkins ec2 instances, etc.

# Running These Playbooks
To run any of my playbooks you only need to provide a private key for the playbook to be able to configure the ec2 instance. These playbooks also have various other variables that can be passed but these variables have defaults if none are provided.
