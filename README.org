#+TITLE: Ansible Playbooks

*Archived Repo*
This repo is no longer used and is left around only for reference. Please look
to [[https://www.github.com/maker2413/SquidsAWS][SquidsAWS]] for a better look at how I am managing my AWS infrastructure now.

These are the playbooks I have made for deploy various instances in my AWS
Environment. These playbooks do various things from deploy and configure
developer ec2 instances, jenkins ec2 instances, etc.

To run any of my playbooks you only need to provide a private key for the
playbook to be able to configure the ec2 instance. These playbooks also have
various other variables that can be passed but these variables have defaults if
none are provided.
